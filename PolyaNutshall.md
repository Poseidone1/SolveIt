# Polya's Teaching Philosophy
Polya's approach centered on three key principles. First, he championed active learning, believing students learn best by discovering solutions themselves rather than being told answers. Second, he emphasized heuristic thinking - the art of guided discovery and learning from experience, viewing problem-solving as a skill that can be developed through practice. Third, he developed sophisticated questioning techniques that guide students toward solutions while encouraging independent thinking.

# Problem-Solving Methodology
It's based on 4 steps methodology based on the [How to Solve It](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691164076/how-to-solve-it) book:
## Step1: Understand the problem
    - Clearly identify what you're being asked to do
    - Gather all available information
    - Identify constraints and limitations
    - Restate the problem in your own words
    - Create visual representations where helpful
    - Verify you have sufficient information
## Create an action plan
    - Search for patterns
    - Draw on similar problems you've solved
    - Break down complex problems into manageable parts
    - Consider working backward from the goal
    - Look for ways to simplify the problem
    - List possible strategies
    - Identify available tools and resources

## Implement the plan
    - Execute your strategy systematically
    - Verify each step
    - Document your attempts
    - Be prepared to start over with a new approach if needed
    - Maintain organized records of your process

## Review the problem aka lesson learnt
   - Evaluate the reasonableness of your solution
   - Verify your results
   - Consider alternative approaches
   - Extract lessons learned
   - Consider broader applications
   - Identify potential improvements for future attempts
